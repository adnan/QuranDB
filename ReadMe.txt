+This project is a Quran (Muslim's holly book) database source.

Whether for academic, personal or recreational purposes, finding a DB source of the Quran is not easy if not impossible. 
This project is database containing the verses (Arabic: Ayah) of the Quran by chapter (Arabic: Surah).


+How this started:
The only reasonable SQL Server database i have found was on a website called Tanzil.info, it is a .sql file (*1) which takes care of the create and insert. It basically creates a table called Quran then inserts the verses line by line (*2).

The problem i've encountered while doing basic searches on the DB is that the Arabic text generated by that script is with tachkil (*3). Tashkil makes searching very ambiguous if not impossible sometimes, searching on the same word might return different results depending on the placement of the world in a sentence (Thats how complex is the Arabic language!).
So the obvious solution for me was to alter the table, add a new column which will receive the same text on the row but without tashkil (*4).
The result (*5) is a table identical to the one generated by Tanzil.info's script having one extra column of the text without tashkil.

+How to use:
- Simply run the CreateInsertScript.sql script and you should get a table with two text columns, one with tashkil signs and one without signs.
- If you want to create the original table as per Tanzil.info, simply run:Arabic-(Original-Book)-1.sql
- If you want to do the same thing that i did (maybe better :)), the after creating the original table, alter that table and add a new text field called AyahTextNoTashkil and run the RemoveTashkilScript.sql script. 

+Satus as of 3/22/2013
The no tashkil column looks ok, i've run some basic searches on words for which the count is known, the results look correct so far, However, some special signs still show up, not sure how those would impact searches.



*1- Only SQL Server for now, will be working on other DB systems soon.
*2- gitHub File: Arabic-(Original-Book)-1.sql as downloaded from Tanzil.info
*3- Tashkil is basically adding little signs to arabic letters which are then pronounced with different tones based on the sign(s) they have. Adding the signs is not arbitrary, they are added to the letters depending on many rules like the position of the word in the sentence. The result is that you have the same word pronounced differently and therefore a search on that world will return the wrong result.
*4-  Script to remove tashkil RemoveTashkilScript.sql 
*5- Script to generate the final table: CreateInsertScript.sql
